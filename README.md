## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I practiced my skills on breaking down the main component structure into multiple `<div>` tags, where I could have a better control in styling them later:

```html
<div class="qr-component">
  <div class="qr-code">...</div>
  <div class="header-rectangle">
    <div class="header-content">...</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

I centered a `<div>` using `width` and `margin` properties:

```css
.header-content {
  width: 256px;
  margin: auto;
}
```

On top of that, I centered the whole body to be in the middle of the screen (Giving attention to the qr-component :) ), by using flexbox:

```css
body {
  ...;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  ...;
}
```

I used CSS Variables to get used to having a centralized control over the global styles of the HTML elements:

```css
:root {
  /* Colors */
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --slate-900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  --slate-500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
  --slate-300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --attribution-color: hsl(228, 45%, 44%);

  /* Fonts */
  --font-heading: 700 120% 0px;
  --font-paragraph: 400 140% 0.2px;
  --pargraph-size: 15px;
  --font-family-outfit: "Outfit", sans-serif;

  --card-shadow: 0px 25px 25px 0px rba(0, 0, 0 / 4.77%);
  --card-radius: 20px;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I believe I can get better and learn more about the following topics, based on my experience with this project:

- Semantic HTML
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox and Grids
- Accessibility
- UI/UX Design Concpets
- Desgining UIs using Figma
